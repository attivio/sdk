# Scanners

Attivio supports the implementation of custom scanners to deliver content into the Attivio workflow from any data source. The SDK specifies the interfaces and annotations the scanner should implement so that it can be configured and controlled from the administration UI. The SDK also specifies the interfaces exposed by Attivio the scanner can use to feed content and access Attivio services.
