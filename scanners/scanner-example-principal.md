# Principal Scanner Example

The sample Attivio project contains the `com.sample.module.SamplePrincipalScanner` sample scanner. The sample shows how to create Attvio users and groups. 

Attivio distributes and documents the Active Directory Principal Scanner and the LDAP Principal Scanner. These scanners cover the majority of use cases. But sometimes it is required to create Attivio users and groups from other sources. 

The sample demonstrates the following:

* The creation of `AttivioPrincipal` objects \(users and groups\).
* Using `AttivioGroupMembership` to add members to groups.
* Using the `DocumentPublisher.feed` method to create principals in the Attivio index.
