###### 4  Ownership; Third Party Software

Ownership of the Products, copies, modifications and derivatives of the 
Products (in whole or in part) and all related patents, copyrights, 
trademarks, trade secrets and other proprietary rights are and will remain 
the sole and exclusive property of Attivio and/or its licensors. Company 
shall use the Products solely for evaluation purposes as expressly permitted 
by this Evaluation License and shall not reverse engineer, adapt, translate, 
decompile or disassemble them. Company shall not sell, disclose, display or 
otherwise make available to others the Products or Related Materials

source code for such Third Party Component ("Third Party License"). 
Company's license rights with respect to individual Third Party Components 
are defined by the terms of any applicable Third Party License; nothing in 
this Evaluation License shall restrict, limit, or otherwise affect any rights or 
obligations Company may have, or conditions to which Company may be 
subject, under such Third Party License. Further, no such third party 
warrants the Products, assumes any liability in connection with the Products 
or undertakes to furnish any support or information relating to the 
Products.  All such third parties are intended third-party beneficiaries of this

###### 5  Confidentiality

5.1 "Confidential Information" herein shall mean all information which is 
written, graphic, machine readable or other tangible form and is marked 
"confidential," "proprietary," "source code," or in some other manner to 
indicate its confidential nature, or which is disclosed orally and designated 
as "confidential" in writing within sixty (60) days from the date of oral 
disclosure, or which under the circumstances of disclosure reasonably ought 
to be considered as confidential. Confidential Information may include, 
without limitation, software programs, technical data, methodologies, know-
how, processes, designs, new products, and marketing plans. Confidential 
Information of Attivio shall expressly include the Products and the terms of 
this Agreement.

5.2 Company shall maintain the Confidential Information of Attivio in 
confidence. Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to 
prevent and restrain any unauthorized disclosure, communication, copying, 
use, distribution, installation or transfer of possession of Confidential 
Information by any of its employees, consultants, and agents to others or 
use it for any purpose, except pursuant to and in order to carry out, the 
terms and objectives of this Agreement. At a minimum, Company shall 
maintain at least the same procedures regarding Attivio's Confidential 
Information that it maintains with respect to its own. Attivio's Confidential 
Information shall not include any information which: (i) becomes part of the 
public domain through no act or omission of Company; (ii) is lawfully 
acquired by Company from a third party without any breach of 
confidentiality to Attivio; (iii) is disclosed by Company to a third party 
without any obligation of confidentiality to Attivio; (iv) is independently 
developed without reference to Confidential Information; or (v) is disclosed 
in accordance with judicial or other governmental order. Without limiting 
the generality of the foregoing, Company shall take all reasonable steps to 
prevent any personnel from removing any proprietary or other legend or 
restrictive notice contained or included in any material provided by Attivio.

5.3 Company agrees to furnish the Confidential Information and Products 
only to its employees or to individuals on the party's premises who are 
acting under its direction and control and who are under obligation to 
protect Company's own Confidential Information. Company shall advise 
Attivio immediately if Company learns or has reason to believe that any 
person having access to the Products or Confidential Information has 
violated or intends to violate the terms of this Evaluation License.  
Company will cooperate at its own expense with Attivio in seeking suitable 
injunctive or other equitable relief against that person.

5.4 Company acknowledges that any disclosure of any aspect of the 
Products or Confidential Information, except as permitted by this Section 5, 
will give rise to irreparable injury to Attivio that is inadequately 
compensable in damages. Company hereby consents to Attivio's obtaining 
of injunctive relief against such disclosure in addition to any other available 
remedy without the necessity of posting a bond and without proof of actual 
damages. All Company's undertakings and obligations relating to 
confidentiality and non-disclosure, whether contained in this Section or 
elsewhere, shall survive for five (5) years after termination of this 
Evaluation License and, with respect to trade secrets, for the duration of 
the trade secret.

5.5 If Company makes any suggestions to Attivio regarding new features, 
functionality or performance that Attivio adopts for its products, such new 
features, functionality or performance shall become the sole and exclusive 
property of Attivio, free from any restriction imposed upon Attivio by the 
provisions of this Section 5.

###### 6  Termination

6.1 If Company fails to comply with a material term or condition of this 
Evaluation License, Attivio may terminate this Evaluation License 
immediately upon written notice to the Company.

6.2 Attivio may also terminate this Evaluation License immediately by 
written notice to Company if Company (a) sells all, or substantially all, of its 
assets, liquidates, or dissolves; (b) materially and/or intentionally breaches

interest in any of the Products without the prior written consent of Attivio.

destroy any and all copies of the Products installed by Company or its 
employees on any system. If requested by Attivio, Company shall, within 
ten (10) days of such request, submit to Attivio an affidavit signed by an 
officer of Company attesting to the destruction of such copies.
